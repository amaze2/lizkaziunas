  My research contributes to the fields of human-computer interaction (HCI), computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) and health informatics by examining the social and organizational contexts of health information systems and lived experiences of health datafication. As an interpretivist researcher, I draw together ethnographic methods and human-centered design approaches to examine people’s everyday health practices and explore the possibilities (and critical dependencies) that come with using health information and technology.
  
  Previously, I was a Research Lead of the Algorithmic Care Project and Postdoctoral Researcher at AI Now Institute, an organization dedicated to investigating the social impacts of artificial intelligence, where I researched AI/ML technologies in healthcare setttings. I received my Ph.D. from University of Michigan's School of Information, M.S. from Syracuse University’s School of Information Studies, M.A. from Yale University, and B.A. from Macalester College.
